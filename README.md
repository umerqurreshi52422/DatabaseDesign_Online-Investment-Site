# DatabaseDesign_Online-Investment-Site
This database design project aims to create an efficient and organized database schema for a company's inventory management system. It includes the design of tables, relationships, and constraints that ensure data accuracy and consistency. The project also considers scalability and security in the implementation of the database.


The Online Bank & Investment Site is a project aimed at providing users with an easy-to-use platform to manage their investments and finances. This database design project is developed to provide a schema that allows for the efficient storage and retrieval of data related to user registration, account management, transaction history, and market data.

The project uses a relational database management system (RDBMS) to store and organize data. The ER model depicts the various entities and relationships involved in the project, including Admin, Users, Account, Credit, Real estate, Forex, Stocks, and Crypto. Each entity is defined by its attributes and relationships with other entities, resulting in a comprehensive database schema.

The SQL queries are provided to create the necessary tables and define the relationships between them. The queries include the creation of tables for Admin, Users, Account, Credit, Real estate, Forex, Stocks, and Crypto. The queries also define primary keys, foreign keys, and multi-value attributes to ensure data integrity and consistency.

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive and efficient database schema that supports the Online Bank & Investment Site's functionality. This project will be of interest to developers, database administrators, and anyone interested in developing an online financial management platform. The project is open-source and available on Github for collaboration and contributions.
